# 🛡️ QuantumShield

## Project Description
**QuantumShield** is a next-generation smart contract built to protect digital assets through a multi-signature inspired security model. It introduces a *shield activation mechanism* that can freeze operations during potential threats, allowing safe fund recovery.

---

## Project Vision
To create an adaptive, quantum-resilient blockchain defense layer that ensures asset safety even under malicious or unpredictable events. QuantumShield aspires to be a standard in decentralized security governance.

---

## Key Features
- 🔐 **Guardian Network** — Designate trusted guardians to assist in activating emergency shields.  
- ⚡ **Emergency Shield Activation** — Instantly freeze all operations to prevent unauthorized access.  
- 💰 **Secure Fund Recovery** — Owner can safely recover assets once the shield is activated.  
- 🧩 **Upgradeable Structure** — Future versions can integrate post-quantum cryptography modules.  

---

## Future Scope
- Integration with **quantum-resistant** signature algorithms (e.g., lattice-based cryptography).  
- **On-chain governance** for decentralized guardian selection.  
- **AI-based anomaly detection** for automatic shield activation.  
- **Cross-chain interoperability** for multi-chain protection.

## Deployment
You can deploy QuantumShield on any EVM-compatible chain (Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, etc.) using:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
